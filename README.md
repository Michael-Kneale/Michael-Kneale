ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Michael-Kneale

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in cyber security and programming!

ðŸŒ± I recently graduated from Macquarie University with a Bachelor of Cyber Security and am currently looking for a graduate role in IT

â˜• I'm most confident with Java, but have experience programming in Python, JavaScript/HTML/CSS, and C

ðŸ“š I recently started studying with LeetCode, as well as towards a Security+ certification, in order to refresh and improve my cyber security and coding skills

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Michael-Kneale

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in cyber security and programming!

ðŸŒ± I graduated from Macquarie University with a Bachelor of Cyber Security and am currently looking for a graduate role in IT (especially cyber security)

â˜• I'm most confident with Java, but have experience programming in Python, JavaScript/HTML/CSS, and C

ðŸ“š Recently, I have been freelancing at DataAnnotation to learn more about AI and make money doing it
